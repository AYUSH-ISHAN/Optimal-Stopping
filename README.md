# Results 
1. Languerre Gaussian Research - All results and experiments stored in Languerre Gaussian Research.pdf. It takes <a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laguerre_polynomials">Languerre Polynomials</a> as the basis function.
2. Simple Gaussian Research - All results and experiments stored in Simple Gaussian_research.pdf. It takes Simple Polynomials as the basis function.
